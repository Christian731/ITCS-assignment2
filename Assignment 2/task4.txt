The atom seems like it has more uses and very friendly to the user, i see it now being better. The downside
is that it did not seem beginner friendly compared to command line, atleast to me. It has a welcome guide but 
it did not help me on learning how to use it properly. The command line you can try things out at the very start
and it will correct or say that there is an error.
